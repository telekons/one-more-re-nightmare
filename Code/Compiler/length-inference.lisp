;;; The following function implements Kildall's algorithm for
;;; optimisation, as described in
;;; <https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/42162/Kildall_A_unified_approach_1973.pdf>.
;;; The end result of this analysis is that we can replace several
;;; bounds checks, each checking for one more character, with one
;;; check that checks for multiple characters.

;;; To compute the minimum lengths required to match from each state,
;;; this algorithm first optimistically makes far too high guesses
;;; about minimum lengths: if a state is not accepting, it guesses
;;; that the state will never reach an accepting state, and thus has
;;; an infinite minimum length; else, it correctly determines that the
;;; minimum length is 0 when the state is accepting. We then propagate
;;; lengths. A state takes one more character to match than its
;;; successors (the "transfer" function), and a set of successors
;;; states has a minimum length that is the minimum of the minimum
;;; length of each successor (the "confluence" function). We treat
;;; states that never reach an accepting state as having infinite
;;; minimum length, so our implementation has to handle some
;;; additional cases that aren't integer arithmetic:
;;;     X ≠ infinity ⇒ X < infinity 
;;;     min(infinity, X) = min(X, infinity) = X for all X
;;;     infinity + 1 = infinity
;;; Minimum lengths are repeatedly propagated until we don't actually
;;; lower anything by propagation. Then we have a correct result.
